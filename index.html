<h1> Privacy Policy Summary </h1>

<p>
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Poke Swipes (“Application”
 for mobile devices that was created by Katori Tech.
 The Application is a tool made for users to record their swipes on screen, 
and replay these over other applications.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. 
The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>

<h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

<p>
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way. 
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. 
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept 
or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

<h2>
Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h2>

<p>
We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks,
 who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Application which helps us keep the cost of the Application low. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Application,
 including, but not limited to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device and your mobile telephone number. To protect the anonymity of this information, 
we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you’ve downloaded to your mobile device,
 the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location information in order to help analyze
 and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Application and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use. </p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information,
 I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions. 

</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
